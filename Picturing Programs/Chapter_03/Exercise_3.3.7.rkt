; Exercise 3.3.7
; How would you construct a picture like ? (Note that the top
; edge of the triangle matches exactly the top edge of the
; square, and the bottom point of the triangle is exactly in the
; middle of the bottom edge of the square.)
; Hint: It is possible to do this, using what youâ€™ve seen so
; far, with no math beyond elementary school.
