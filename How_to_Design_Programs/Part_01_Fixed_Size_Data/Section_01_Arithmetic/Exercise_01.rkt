; Exercise 1
; Add the following definitions for x and y to DrRacketâ€™s
; definitions area:
(define x 12)
(define y 5)
; Now imagine that x and y are the coordinates of a
; Cartesian point. Write down an expression that computes
; the distance of this point to the origin, that is, a
; point with the coordinates (0,0).

(sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y)))
