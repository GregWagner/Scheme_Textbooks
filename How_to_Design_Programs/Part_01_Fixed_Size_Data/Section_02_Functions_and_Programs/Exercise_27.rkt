; Exercise 27
; Our solution to the sample problem contains several
; constants in the middle of functions. As One Program,
; Many Definitions already points out, it is best to give
; names to such constants so that future readers understand
; where these numbers come from. Collect all definitions in
; DrRacketâ€™s definitions area and change them so that all
; magic numbers are refactored into constant definitions.
